Image quality  in diagnosis and screening of retinopathy of prematurity

What causes ROP? ROP occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow and spread throughout the retina, the tissue that lines the back of the eye. These abnormal blood vessels are fragile and can leak, scarring the retina and pulling it out of position. This causes a retinal detachment.
The solution to this is getting the best  quality of images and detecting those images are affected of ROP by visuallization and for further usage developing training and testing of the images using cnn and aiml techniques 


Here I included enhancement1 google colab file whcich containts code and output of retinal images

                and the images.zip consists of random outputs of the retina 
                
                from this technique we can find or visualize the rop affected retina in stage-1 (40%) stage 2(60-70%)
                
                login zip file containts the basic python login web page  file using kivy 
                
                retina zip  file consits of images of rop 
                image1 - Detection of stage1 rop
                image2 - gray scale image
                image3 - enhancement of poor image
apk here is a login page of a docter or an asha worker where he can add his credientials 
for further approch if a docter adds the image of retina it enhances the image of infants and gets the different images  and for enhancement and getting different images the backend code which was used in goolecolab was used
