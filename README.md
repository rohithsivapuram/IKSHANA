Image quality  in diagnosis and screening of retinopathy of prematurity

What causes ROP? ROP occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow and spread throughout the retina, the tissue that lines the back of the eye. These abnormal blood vessels are fragile and can leak, scarring the retina and pulling it out of position. This causes a retinal detachment.
The solution to this is getting the best  quality of images and detecting those images are affected of ROP by visuallization and for further usage developing training and testing of the images using cnn and aiml techniques 


Here I included enhancement1 google colab file whcich containts code and output of retinal images
                and the images.zip consists of random outputs of the retina 
                from this technique we can find or visualize the rop affected retina in stage-1 (40%) stage 2(60-70%)
